			<h4>Almost everybody feels like an impostor</h4>

			<p>I think that this is something that applies across professions. We are all sure that at some point somebody is going to to run into the room screaming, "Hey this clown shouldn't be here!" The truth is that nobody really knows what they are doing, and we are all just trying to make it through.</p>

			<h4>The Ruby Community is amazing!</h4>

			<p>I have never worked for a company that uses primarily Ruby. Instead I have consistently worked with a Java team, while I have used Ruby to create automated tests.</p>
			<p>I'm not saying that they are nicer or better people than other languages, but there is definitely a culture of kindness that is a part of being a Rubyist.</p>
			<p>Anytime you need help, or are looking for advice, just reach out! They are there to help you! They want you to succeed! MINSWAN!</p>

			<h4>Almost nobody knows this stuff off of the top of their heads</h4>
			<p>When I very first started in tech, I was sure that developers just sat down and started pounding out amazing applications from their heads. I was terrified that somebody would look over and see me looking something up on google.</p>
			<p>The truth is that everybody googles all of the time. It is so hard to actually code when you don't have access to the web. Stack Overflow and the Ruby documentation are such boons!</p>
			<p>Don't be afraid to look things up. Don't be afraid to admit you have no idea what is going on with somebody sitting next to you.</p>
